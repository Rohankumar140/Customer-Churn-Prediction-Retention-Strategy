# Customer Churn Prediction & Retention Strategy

Predicting customer churn using machine learning, statistical analysis, and segmentation, with business-focused insights and recommendations.

## üìå Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Predict which customers are at risk of churning
- Understand key drivers behind churn using SHAP
- Segment customers by risk and value using KMeans
- Propose targeted retention strategies to improve business outcomes

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- **Languages**: Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- **ML & Modeling**: Scikit-learn, RandomForest, Logistic Regression
- **Explainability**: SHAP (TreeExplainer)
- **Visualization**: Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Segmentation**: KMeans Clustering
- **Presentation**: PowerPoint-style summary and business recommendations

## üìä Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Analyzed churn rates across contract types, payment methods, and customer behavior.

3. **Statistical Analysis**  
   Used t-tests and chi-square tests to identify significant churn-related variables.

4. **Modeling**  
   Built and evaluated classification models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression) to predict churn.

5. **Model Interpretation**  
   Used SHAP to identify global and local feature importance influencing churn.

6. **Customer Segmentation**  
   Clustered customers using KMeans based on churn probability and behavior (e.g., high risk‚Äìhigh value).

7. **Business Recommendations**  
   Proposed segment-specific strategies like loyalty offers or service outreach for at-risk customers.
